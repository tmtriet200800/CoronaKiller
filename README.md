If you are bored with the COVID-19 season but want to find a game to entertain, here we introduce you to a game called Corona killer. 

This is an incomplete(2 levels) project of a very simple 2D space shooter game created with Unity.
The game itself is not refined, yet it contains all the "ingredients" needed to learn the paradigms underlying videogames development
including (but not limited to) player-enemies interaction, physics, GUI, sounds, 2D parallax, etc.
With the simplicity of this game, it simply aims to bring fun and make you look back to your childhood’s spaceship games with some new modern features. 

Unity version 2018.4.36f1
